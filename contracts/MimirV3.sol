/**
 * MimirV3 — AI-settled prediction market, with fees. Runs on any EVM chain.
 *
 * Two stake modes, fixed at deploy:
 *   - Native (usdc == address(0)): Arc, where USDC is the gas token. Stakes
 *     move through msg.value; there is no approval step.
 *   - ERC-20 (usdc != address(0)): Base, Arbitrum and anything else where
 *     USDC is a token. Stakes are pulled with transferFrom after an approve,
 *     and msg.value must be zero.
 *
 * What v3 adds over v2:
 *   - Fees charged on profit only, never on the gross payout. Staking 10 and
 *     winning 11 back must never leave you with less than 10.
 *   - The fee policy is snapshotted onto the claim at creation, so a later
 *     policy change cannot rewrite the economics of a market people already
 *     put money into.
 *   - Agent attribution: a position opened through a registered agent pays
 *     that agent's owner a share of the profit it produced.
 *   - Fee changes are timelocked and hard-capped, so no single owner action
 *     can take a meaningful share of a winner's profit by surprise.
 *   - Fees accrue to a pull balance. A push to a recipient that reverts would
 *     take the whole settlement down with it.
 *   - Settlement pushes carry a fixed gas stipend, so a recipient contract
 *     cannot burn the resolve transaction's gas; anything it refuses is parked.
 *   - An escape hatch: an ACTIVE claim the oracle has not resolved within
 *     RESOLUTION_GRACE_SECONDS of its deadline can be refunded by anyone.
 *   - Two-step ownership, a timelocked oracle change and a pause switch that
 *     stops new positions but never settlement, refunds or withdrawals.
 *
 * Known limit: invite keys travel in calldata, so a private claim hides its
 * link from the UI, not from someone reading the chain.
