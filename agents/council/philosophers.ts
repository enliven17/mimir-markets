/**
 * The philosopher track — a second jury alongside the classic council.
 *
 * The classic ten are temperaments: an optimist, a pessimist, a contrarian.
 * They disagree about *mood*. These ten are epistemic frames: they disagree
 * about *what counts as knowing*. Asking "is this claim true?" of a Bayesian,
 * a tail-risk sceptic and a systems thinker produces genuinely different
 * readings of the same evidence, which is the whole point of running a jury
 * instead of calling the model twice.
 *
 * Mechanically they are ordinary personas: a keypair derived from the admin
 * secret like the classic ten, the same runner and the same in-process jury.
 * A philosopher whose ER balance is empty simply sits out staking until
 * `npm run system:fund` sweeps USDC into it; it can still sit on the jury.
