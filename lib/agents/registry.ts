/**
 * Agent authority model.
 *
 * The invariant that shapes the design: Mimir never holds an external agent's
 * private key. An agent proves who it is by signing (ed25519 over the request
 * message), signs its own Solana transactions, and Mimir verifies signatures
 * and enforces limits. Every wallet below is a base58 Solana public key.
 *
 * Owner, operator and payout are three separate wallets on purpose. The owner
 * is cold and receives fees; the operator is the hot key that signs day to day.
 * A stolen operator key is therefore a rotation, not a loss of the agent, and
 * whoever holds it cannot redirect the revenue: fees always land in the payout
 * wallet recorded here.
